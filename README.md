# Navbar Project

The purpose of the project is to provide a Navbar using plain JavaScript without using frameworks.  However, Font Awesome and Google Fonts will be used.

## UX

As a user, when I hover over the links, I expect a different color.

As a user, when I click on an external link, I expect the link to open in a new window without leaving the Navbar Project page.

As a user, when I hover on an external link, I expect a brief description of the external link (e.g. LinkedIn).

As a user, when I click on to a link, I expect to go to the correct page.

As a user, when the width is less than 800px, the social links are hidden in the navigation bar.

This project consists of:

        - index.html (Home Page)
        - about.html
        - projects.html
        - contact.html

Organising principle is interests or biography.

In the about page, there is a brief information on what I do.

In the projects page, there are links to live projects and GitHub repositories in each project.

In the contact page, there are links to professional associations (e.g. British Computer Society) and professional social media (e.g. LinkedIn).
